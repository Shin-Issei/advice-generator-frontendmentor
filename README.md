### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

Styling components without a React library is something that I will not be doing in the future. Most of the time I end up just writting CSS manually however that is going to change. Future projects aren't going to be as small as this and so manual CSS creation is a bad idea.
